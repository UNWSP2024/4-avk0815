# Program #5: Bank Balance
# Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount that he or she has budgeted for a month.
# A loop should then prompt the user to enter each of his or her expenses for the 
# month and keep a running total. (Enter 0 to exit the loop)  
# When the loop finishes, the program should display the amount that the 
# user is over or under budget.

    budget = 0.0
    difference = 0.0

    total = 0.0
